## Hi there! :smile_cat:

My name is Angel and this is my landing page for my GitHub account! Please let me introduce myself and tell you more about me and my interests below.

### About me
- **Name pronunciation**: /ˈaŋxel/
- **Pronouns**: he/him
- **Location**: From Spain but currently living and working in the UK.
- **Languages**: Spanish, Catalan, and English. 
- **Interests outside work**: science, nature, music, books, cats, and cooking. 

### A little bit about my previous education and work experience
After studying Science A-levels (Spanish equivalent), I studied a Quality Control Lab Technician certification and then a Bachelor's Degree in Veterinary Medicine at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. Then I worked as a Veterinary Surgeon in Spain for almost a year before I moved to the UK where I worked as a Veterinary Surgeon for more than 3 years.

### I'm currently working on...
Veterinary Medicine is not my only passion, I've always been passionate about using data to solve complex problems and support informed decision-making. That's why I decided to change my career into Data Science. So recently I completed an intensive Skills Bootcamp in Data Science, where I’ve developed hands-on skills in Python, machine learning, data analysis, and visualisation. 
I’m eager to apply my expertise in a professional setting, collaborate on impactful projects, and continue growing in this dynamic industry. Open to opportunities where I can contribute through data-driven insights. Let’s connect!

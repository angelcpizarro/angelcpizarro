## My Journey: From Veterinary Medicine to Data Science and Analytics

My background lies in **Veterinary Medicine**, where I spent several years working as a **Veterinary Surgeon**. Now, I'm transitioning into a career that allowed me to combine my scientific knowledge and analytical mindset with a passion for problem-solving.

After years in veterinary practice, I found my true calling in **Data Science and Analytics**. This led me to complete an intensive **Data Science Bootcamp** and continue learning by myself, which allowed me to develop skills in:

- **Python** programming
- **Machine Learning** algorithms
- **Data Analysis** and **Visualisation** techniques
- **Advanced MS Excel**
- **Querying with SQL**
- **BI tools such as Tableau (in progress)**

I am now focused on using data to help organisations make informed decisions and drive business impact. I am excited to continue building my expertise and collaborating with like-minded professionals.

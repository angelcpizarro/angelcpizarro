## My Journey: From Veterinary Medicine to Data Science and Analytics

My background lies in **Veterinary Medicine**, where I spent several years working as a **Veterinary Surgeon** in both Spain and the UK. After completing my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Veterinary Medicine at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, I transitioned into a career that allowed me to combine my scientific knowledge with a passion for problem-solving.

After years in veterinary practice, I found my true calling in **Data Science and Analytics**. This led me to complete an intensive **Data Science Bootcamp** and continue learning by myself, which allowed me to develop skills in:

- **Python** programming, data analytics, and data visualisation
- **Machine Learning** algorithms
- **Data Analysis** and **Visualisation** techniques
- **SQL**

I am now focused on leveraging data to help organisations make informed decisions and drive business impact. I am excited to continue building my expertise and collaborating with like-minded professionals.

- **SQL & Database Management**: Optimising queries, designing databases, and handling large datasets.
- **Power BI**: Creating dynamic dashboards and visualisations to extract actionable insights from data.
- **Machine Learning**: Applying machine learning models to solve real-world problems, including predictions tasks.

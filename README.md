## My Journey: From Veterinary Medicine to Data Science and Analytics

My background lies in **Veterinary Medicine**, where I spent several years working as a **Veterinary Surgeon** in both Spain and the UK. After completing my Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Veterinary Medicine at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, I transitioned into a career that allowed me to combine my scientific knowledge with a passion for problem-solving.

After years in veterinary practice, I found my true calling in **Data Science and Analytics**. This led me to complete an intensive **Data Science Bootcamp** and continue learning by myself, which allowed me to develop skills in:

- **Python** programming
- **Machine Learning** algorithms
- **Data Analysis** and **Visualisation** techniques
- **Advanced MS Excel**
- **Querying with SQL**

I am now focused on using data to help organisations make informed decisions and drive business impact. I am excited to continue building my expertise and collaborating with like-minded professionals.

## Projects

Below are some of my key data projects. Click each title to explore the code, documentation, and visualisations:

### üõ≥Ô∏è Titanic Survival EDA
- Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Exploratory Data Analysis on the classic Titanic dataset. Cleaned data, explored feature relationships, and visualised survival trends. An excellent introduction to EDA and storytelling with data.

### üêæ Vet Clinic Data Analysis (In Progress)
- Tools: SQL ‚Ä¢ Python ‚Ä¢ Excel ‚Ä¢ Tableau
- An end-to-end analysis of fictional vet clinic data. I designed a relational database, queried using SQL, cleaned and analysed in Python, and visualised insights in Tableau. Currently exploring a machine learning extension to predict no-shows or treatment outcomes.

### ü´Ä Heart Disease Prediction (Coming Soon)
- Tools: Python ‚Ä¢ Scikit-learn ‚Ä¢ ML Algorithms
- Developing a binary classification model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data. Includes feature engineering, model training, and evaluation with precision-recall analysis.
